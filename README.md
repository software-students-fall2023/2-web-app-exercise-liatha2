# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

What if shopping was funny and non-political? 
## User stories

1. As a super funny person, I want to add my own "guns" to the database so people who view it can laugh.
2. As a person with a sense of humor, I want to be able to remove "guns" that I don't view as funny so that the Gun Store can be funnier.
3. As a big fan of the Gun Store, I want to be able to search for my favorite "guns", so that I can find them easily.
4. As a Gun Store member, I want to be able to make changes to the "guns" I've already added, so that I can improve my "guns".
